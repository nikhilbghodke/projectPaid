/**
 * This class is used to define Extensions which are used for converting non osgi dependencies to osgi dependencies.
 * Inorder to convert a jar into OSGi bundle, it must be specified in dependencies of the project and `bundle` function
 * must be called for that jar.
 *
 * The mechanism that is employed to convert jars to bundles is simple and as follows
 *1) Unzip the jar in `build/unpacked` directory, this is accomplished by creating a task of type {@Link Copy} and then calling it.
 *2) Define a task of type {@Link Bundle} which will again create a jar from the unzipped jar in `build/unpacked` directory.
 *3) The task task of type {@Link Bundle} is configured as per user inputs for Manifest Headers and the task is made to run(
 * by calling its method which implement @TaskAction)
 *4) Repeat step 1 for all the jars specified using `bundle` method.
